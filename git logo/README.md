-The Git logo is an orange square that is rotated 45 degrees. Inside the square are two lines.  
-The first line reaches the edge of the square. It has a circle at the end of the line. It also has another circle in the middle of the line.  
-The second line runs vertically down the middle of the square. The line has a circle at the end.  
-The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.The Git logo is a square that is rotated 45 degrees. We will use the CSS transform property to rotate our logo.  
-Our first line is the one that attaches to the edge of the square. The square is 150px long. I will make the line have a length of 110px. The color of the line will be white.

This line will be positioned absolutely to make sure it is in the right spot on the logo.  
-In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.

We will use this property to create the circle in the middle of the line. We will position this circle as absolute. As it is a circle it will have the same height and width and a border-radius of 50%.  
-In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.

We will do the same thing to add a circle at the end of our first line.  
-Just like the first line, we will add a second line. This line will also be positioned absolutely. We will use the top and left values to set the location. The last thing we need to do is to rotate the line 45 degrees like the square.  
-The last thing we need to do is to use the pseudo class ::before to add a circle to the end of this line.
